# NetMonster Core  
  
üöß Work in progress! üöß    
    
Lightweight Android library that is build over [Telephony SDK](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/package-summary). NetMonster core is extracted from [NetMonster](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.mroczis.netmonster) application and backports several Telephony features to older Android devices.  
  
Why use NetMonster Core instead of legacy API?  
 - Validation - library validates data from RIL and corrects them if possible 
 - Richer information - additional functions for cell identity and cell signal that will make your code more understandable  
 - Backport - several non-accessible signal or identity fields are now accessible without boilerplate code  
 - Tested - tested on real devices, 50 000+ active users  

### New functions

### Usage

NetMonster Core focuses on mapping of two AOSP's ways to fetch current cell information:
 - [TelephonyManager.getAllCellInfo()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#getAllCellInfo())
 - [TelephonyManager.getCellLocation()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#getCellLocation()) (deprecated in AOSP)

Whilst using NetMonster Core you just need to retrieve instance of `TelephonyManagerCompat` and
call method whose name corresponds to AOSP's one.

```kotlin
TelephonyManagerCompat.getInstance(this).apply {
    getAllCellInfo { cellList : List<ICell> ->
        
    }

    val cellLocation : List<ICell> = getCellLocation()
}
```
